(Elm + ThreeJS + HTML5 + TypeScript/JavaScript + Erlang/OTP)

"Digital Mage Uprising" in a Sci-Fi style can offer an engaging plot, blending elements of technological progress and magic. Here's a possible scenario:

In the distant future, humanity has reached a level of technological development where virtual worlds have become an integral part of everyday life. A new form of energy has emerged in digital reality, capable of interacting with human consciousness and the magical aspects of the world.

However, with the advent of this energy, a dark side of magic has surfaced. Skilled "digital mages" began to control the energy for their own purposes, threatening the integrity of virtual worlds and reality itself. Players take on the role of a mage who possesses a unique ability to manipulate this energy.

The story unfolds in a world where technology and magic converge, and the player's character finds themselves at the center of a rebellion against ominous digital mages. Throughout the adventure, players will explore virtual locations, solve puzzles, battle digital monsters, and unravel the mysteries of digital magic.
